My Approach

- Initialized the project using Vite

- Configured Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI styling.

- Integrated Redux Toolkit to manage API calls, loading, and error states efficiently.

- Built a reusable UserList component to display user data fetched from the API.
s
- Implemented search functionality using useSearchParams to sync search values with the URL and send them as query parameters (q) for fetching filtered results.
